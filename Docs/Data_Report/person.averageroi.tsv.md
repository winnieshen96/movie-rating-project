## General summary of the data
Based on the data on hand, calculated the average roi for each person in the data
## Data quality summary
Because the data is sparse, some people only have one entry in movies, therefore the average roi for them is the roi for that movie, which cannot be used as training data because that is merely memorization not generalization.
